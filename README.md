Elementary Number Theory for Rust primitive types

Currently the fastest library for factorization and primality checking in the interval 0;2^64 that is available in Crates.io and possibly in the entire Rust-lang ecosysytem. 
Algebraic definitions of primality and factorization are used, permitting checks like -127.is_prime() to return true and unique factorizations to be considered unsigned.
